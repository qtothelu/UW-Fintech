# Keeping up with the law

## Overview and Origin
	Hummingbird is an anti-money-laundering platform used by banks as well as fintech, lending and credit companies. The regtech company started in June 2017 at Walnut, California USA by Jesse Reiss, JoAnn Barefoot, Joe Robinson, Matthew Van Buskirk, and Ryan Gerard [1]. The idea of the company started as a passion to “fight financial crime” [2].

	Hummingbird is a relatively new startup that is still in the process of company funding. The company’s initial crowd funded round was $3 million dollars from TTV Capital, Omidyar Network, Homebrew, and Designer Fund in October 22, 2018 [3]. An additional $8.2 million dollars was raised in July 16, 2020 from Florish Ventures, Lachy Groom, Jon Zieger and previous investors. The company’s last round fund is primarily to focus towards automating the financial compliance technology through data collaboration and machine learning.

## Business Activities:
	Essentially all crimes related to financial transactions have a digital footprint whether it’s drug cartels, organized crime, weapons sales, political corruption, and human trafficking. The platform Hummingbird created assists investigators reduce their investigation time and help discover accurate findings.  

	The powerful Hummingbird platform is intended to help financial institutions fight crimes [5]. Some of their customers are Etsy, Visa, Stripe and Hatchbank. Originally Hummingbird started as security payment platform. Security payments were built as a preventive medium to track and prevent illegal transactions but preventive measures are not enough. 

	Since the Hummingbird platform just started, Hummingbird is only available in the United Kingdom and United States. The investigations the platform searches for matches the jurisdiction’s law enforcement. Since every country has different laws, the platform is not currently functional for every country. 

	The advantage of Hummingbird is that the technology is aimed towards enforcing, emerging anti-money laundering, and existing anti-money laundering. Many other RegTech companies are preventive technology but cannot help legal enforcement find anti-money laundering activity that have bypassed the preventive technology.

	Hummingbird technology currently compile trained ML models into tensor computation. The ML models are from Microsoft product. It allows users to seamlessly leverage neural network frameworks such as PyTorch to accelerate traditional ML models [7]. In addition to the ML models, the company have created inhouse softwares built to process multiple sources of data. Data leads could be in the form of a pdf, excel, and etc. 

## Landscape:

	The Regtech industry have always been a trend ever since internet started. As financial institutions deal with faster internet and big data, tracking financial transactions for illegal activity have been increasingly difficult. There have been many preventive technology such as security payments, AI driven risk management database, and inhouse compliance tools introduced by companies such as ComplyAdvantage, Continuity and Square but they are just preventive measures.


## Results

	Since Hummingbird is still developing their technology, it is unclear their impact so far. Anti-money laundering enforcement technology seem to be a fairly new industry. The financial institution world is only in data security space where they are hoping to catch most of the illegal activity as the first line of defense. Anything past the first line of defense many companies don’t have the ability to look into. 

	Some of the core metrics companies in RegTech space use to measure success are ease of use. Many regtech technology may be not useful if only engineers know how to use the platform. Developing a user interface for all users is needed for law enforcement to be able to use the technology themselves. Another metric is showing the technology’s track record. Hummingbird reported that their products “have driven efficiency gains of 80-90% in financial services providers’ workflows for investigating and reporting suspicious financial activity” [8]. 

## Recommendations

	If I were on the board for Hummingbird, I believe they can leverage their technology and user interface better with access to more data. One way to access more data is working with local governments for access to data. I would also open the company to investigating other means of payments such as cryptocurrency, gold, and silver.

	Offering Hummingbird gives financial institutions another chance to catch illegal activity that have bypass their initial internal control securities.

	The technologies that my recommendation would utilize are cryptocurrency payment platforms. I would also consider barter trade marketplaces such as Facebook market place or even Craigslist when scanning the internet for illegal activity. Bank institutions only have currency transactions.
